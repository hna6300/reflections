What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When initializing a repository, a ".git" file will be created. We need to initialize a repository in order to see the log (history) of commits made to that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different from the working directory in a sense that it only contains files that will be committed, not every file. After the commit is made, the repository's history will now contain the commit.
