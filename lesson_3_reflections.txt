When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would prefer to use a remote repository on GitHub when I want to back up or share my work with others online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some of the changes made by other people to the remote on GitHub might be unauthorized by me. Also, pulling changes after every commit might be a waste of time/effort.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: copies of a repository on GitHub
Clones: copies of a repository on local computers
Branches: commits of different purposes (experiments, multiple contributors,...)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally? (using git fetch)
So that we can merge these branches locally when we wish to do so.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I can exchange code with my collaborators, but it is not as convenient and safe as using GitHub.
